# MatrixOperations
The project contains implementation of basic matrix operations in java. For now there is only one operation added - rotating the matrix. Please note, that the project enables to rotate the NxN matrix also in place, as it space efficient.

As the project is created for a self improvement reasons, it can be developed in a very unregullar way.
