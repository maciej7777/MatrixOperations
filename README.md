# MatrixOperations

## About the project
The project contains implementation of basic matrix operations in java. For now there is only one operation added - rotating the matrix. The project enables to rotate the NxM matrix with additional structure, or rotate NxN matrix in place, as it space efficient.

## How does a matrix rotation work?
An example of such an operation is presented below. The frist matrix is a strat matrix:

By rotatin the matrix it can be transformed to the following matrix:

As one can note, the matrix is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Notes
As the project is created for a self improvement reasons, it can be developed in a very unregullar way.
